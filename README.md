# One Project Till I Die

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to a lifelong project: coding one HTML5 application every day. Each project is kept in its own folder, named with a number and a short title.

## Structure

- Each daily project has its own folder:
  - `1.Quiz Game/`
  - `2.Github profile finder/`
  - ...and so on.

- Inside each folder you'll find:
  - `index.html` – The main HTML file for the app.
  - `style.css` – Styles for the app.
  - `script.js` – All JavaScript logic.

## Projects

1. **Quiz Game**  
   A basic quiz application. You can add your HTML, CSS, and JS code to the respective files.

2. **Github Profile Finder**  
   An app to search and display GitHub user profiles. Add your code to the provided files.

## How To Use

- Every day, create a new folder named with the next number and project title (e.g., `3.My Next App/`).
- Add your `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files.
- Paste your code inside the relevant files.
- Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
